This past week we have taken a look at building and deploying web applications using the **M**ongodb **E**xpress **R**eact **N**ode stack. This has been a ton of fun to work with both the backend and frontend on a single application. At first it was a bit overwhelming when it came to deployment and making sure all of your routes/config/environment variables are all good to go with a bit of practice it became easier to get into a flow. Deployment is actually not as bad as I had originally thought it would be.
