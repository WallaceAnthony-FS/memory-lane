React Native is a popular framework for building mobile applications using React. If you're already familiar with React, then using React Native will feel familiar to you, as it uses many of the same concepts and components.

One of the key differences between React and React Native is that React Native uses native components instead of web components like React does. This means that your React Native app will look and feel more like a native app, rather than a web app running in a mobile browser.

One thing that may surprise you when you first start using React Native is how easy it is to get started. With just a few lines of code, you can create a simple "Hello, world" app that will run on both iOS and Android devices. This can be a great way to quickly prototype your app and see how it will look and feel on different devices.

Another thing that may be different from your experience with React is that React Native uses an asynchronous programming model. This means that your code will often be executed in a non-blocking way, which can take some getting used to if you're used to a more synchronous programming style.

Overall, I think that React Native is a great framework for building mobile apps, and if you're already familiar with React, then it's definitely worth giving it a try. It's a fun and powerful way to build mobile apps that look and feel native on both iOS and Android devices.
