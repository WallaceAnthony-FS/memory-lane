# What is Deno?
Deno is a JavaScript runtime re-imagined by the creator of node, Ryan Dahl. Deno is a JavaScript runtime built upon V8 with native support for TypeScript. Deno promises to overcome many of the short comings of Nodejs.

### Why I like Deno
I can't put my finger on it but I honesty have a blast creating projects using Deno. Is it the fresh (pun intended) new nature of something like Deno? Is it the native TypeScript support? Is it the familiarity with standard web api's with first class support in Deno? It could be any or all of these things. I have been working with Deno for the past 3 years since its release and I have yet to tire of building new things with Deno. The Deno team recently released Fresh, a frontend frame work built with Deno and Preact and I can't put it down. Something about this ecosystem has me wanting to build build build like no other framework combination has before it.
