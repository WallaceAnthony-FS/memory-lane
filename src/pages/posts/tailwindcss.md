### TLDR;
Give it a try, you may end up loving it.


## First impressions

Initially I was hesitant to give [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) a try. After looking at examples, and seeing other developers work with tailwind it honestly made no sense to me. "Why write 20 class names that look just like css properties when you can write the properties yourself." was my initial interpretation. "This must be terrible for reusability" was another thought running through my mind. But tailwind had such love among the community there must be something else going on that people love about this framework. What am I missing? After finally giving tailwind a chance I have come to the conclusion that..... I was wrong. Tailwind is amazing to work with once you have the tooling in place. Personally I do believe it requires the tailwind plugin with vscode to make it manageable but once you have that going it's _chefs kiss_. The utility classes just make sense. Rather than coming up with your own class name **and** writing css properties you simply need the class. Reusability is also no concern when you use a frontend framework and simply create components. No more repeated classes. Long story short, I am a fan. I love the features tailwind brings to the table.
